# Responsive_webDesign
Freecodecamp Responsive web design certification Projects and certificates.

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I've learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

Then, I've built some webpages to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, I learned modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, I learned how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

Then its time to put my newly learnt skills to work. By working on these projects, I had got a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts I have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

By Completing these five web programming projects mentioned below to earn my Responsive Web Design certification from freecodecamp.

I've done these five projects in this certification course.
