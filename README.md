# Responsive_webDesign
Freecodecamp Responsive web design certification Projects and certificates.

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I've learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

Then, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

Time to put your newly learnt skills to work. By working on these projects, you will get a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts you have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

Complete the five web programming projects below to earn your Responsive Web Design certification.
